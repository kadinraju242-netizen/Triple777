/* ============================================================
   Triple 7 Holdings — Trade Desk lots
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   EVERY FIELD BELOW IS TAKEN VERBATIM FROM THE LIVE DESK at
   triple7holdings.co.za/trade. Nothing here is invented: no
   prices, no carat weights, no purities, no certificates, no
   origins beyond what the desk itself states.

   Fields the live desk does NOT publish are left null on purpose
   — the UI hides them rather than filling them with plausible
   nonsense. They populate from Supabase when Person 2's tables
   are live; the column names match COMMERCE.md.

   This file is development data standing in for the `lots` table.
   Delete it once the real table is seeded.
